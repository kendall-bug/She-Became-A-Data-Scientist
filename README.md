# She-Became-A-Data-Scientist
She Became is a Louisville non-profit, after-school program for third through fifth grade girls dedicated to educating young girls on the many possible career options available to them.

My presentation is called "She Became a Data Scientist," where I discussed what a data scienctist is, the education and experience someone needs to enter data science, and what someone with a career in data science does! 

This script creates a WordCloud from the popular song "Savage Love" by Jason Derulo to give the girls an example of what a Data Scientist can do. Code was provided to the students so they could create their own word cloud as well!
